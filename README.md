# Mac-MFA-OTP
Here is my personal project that I proposed as the solution for our company's requirement to implement MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) on our Macbooks. I had experience in mobile development in the past, so I thought this was the time to get myself motivated and a chance to dust off my skills in Objective-C and Swift.

## Requirements
- Xcode 12 or latest
- working knowlege in Objective-C and Swift
- understanding of [TOTP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6238)
-  understanding of Apple's [Authorization Plug-ins](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/authorization_plug-ins)
- JAMF Pro and JAMF Connect
